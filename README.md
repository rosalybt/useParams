# Age of empires

This is a page made just for fun and obviously to learn Routes with Parameters by consuming an API - react router.
Display civilizations and clicking on the name of the civilization to get more information about it.

API that i used [Age of Empires I](https://age-of-empires-2-api.herokuapp.com/api/v1)

It's not a fancy page, ok? I just try to practice
, thank u!
